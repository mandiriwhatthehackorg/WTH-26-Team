description: A new Flutter application.

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/background.png
    - images/background_login.jpg
    - images/illustration.png
    - images/logo.png
    - images/logo_white.png
    - images/ic_account.png
    - images/ic_credit.png
    - images/ic_debit.png
    - images/ic_entertaintment.png
    - images/ic_menu_chat.png
    - images/ic_menu_home.png
    - images/ic_more.png
    - images/ic_payment.png
    - images/ic_private.png
    - images/ronaldo.jpg
    - images/ic_batik_background.png
    - images/ic_calendar.png
    - images/ic_cs.png
    - iamges/ic_market.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: MyriadPro
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/MyriadPro-Regular.otf
        - asset: fonts/MyriadPro-Light.otf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/MyriadPro-Regular.otf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/MyriadPro-SemiBold.otf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/MyriadPro-BoldCond.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/MyriadPro-Bold.otf
          weight: 800
